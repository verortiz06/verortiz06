# Hi there, I'm Veronica Ortiz!

Howdy! Though Tomball, Texas will always be my home at heart, I am currently a **sophomore majoring in Economics and minoring in Data Science and Marketing at the University of Notre Dame**. I am incredibly intrigued by understanding and analyzing the intertwining of global economies and markets while prioritizing the common good.

## üìö Student at the University of Notre Dame

- üë©‚Äçüíª  Class of 2027
- üåé  Economics Major, Data Science and Marketing Minors
- ‚ö°  Fun fact: I love music! I played piano for about 6 years, was in my middle school and high school's honor orchestra for 7 years, and I am currently in one of my university's choirs! More recently, I have picked up the guitar and I love just playing and singing along.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Skills

Python, Microsoft Visual Studio Code, STATA

## üï∞Ô∏è Current and Past Projects
### Present:
- [Basic Streamlit App](https://github.com/verortiz06/ORTIZ-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic-streamlit-app)
- [Tidy Data Project](https://github.com/verortiz06/ORTIZ-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project)

- [Unsupervised Machine Learning App](https://github.com/verortiz06/ORTIZ-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLUnsupervisedApp)
### Past:
- **Econometrics Fall 2024:** In this class, my final project consisted of answering a research question of my choosing. My research question was "Does the Ability to Speak English in the United States Affect Income?" Through a thorough selection of Census data and using econometric regression analysis in STATA, I answered this research question and additionally got insights at how other variables affect income in the United States, such as: age, gender, years living in the US, and highest level of education attained.

## üéØ Goals:
By the end of the Spring 2025 semester, I hope to have a thorough understanding of Python and how it, and other data tools such at Streamlit, can be used to go through the Data Science process of exploratory data analysis and beyond. I especially hope to master the art of gleaning information from data, evaluating the impact of results, and being able to best present and communiticate those valuable insights.
